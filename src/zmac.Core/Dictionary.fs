(* 
    The Z-Machine Dictionary layout is as follows:
    1-byte      Number of word separator characters which follow
    n-bytes     Word separator characters, as ASCII chars
    1-byte      Size of each word entry in the dictionary, call it "w"
    1-word      Number of entries in the dictionary

    In versions before Version 4:
    4-bytes     An encoding of 6 Z-characters
    w-4 bytes   "Data" to be used by the game

    In versions 4 and later:
    6-bytes     An encoding of 9 Z-characters
    w-4 bytes   "Data" to be used by the game
